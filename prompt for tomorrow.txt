I need help implementing a complete audit trail system for a medical patient records application. Here's the context:

1. Current AuditTrail model:
python
class AuditTrail(models.Model):
ACTION_CHOICES = [
('CREATE', 'Create'),
('UPDATE', 'Update'),
('DELETE', 'Delete'),
]
patient = models.ForeignKey('Patient', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
action = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=ACTION_CHOICES)
user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)
timestamp = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
changes = models.JSONField(default=dict)

2. Requirements:
- Need to track all important patient-related actions (creation, updates, deletions)
- Must capture clinical data entries (vitals, labs, medications, diagnoses, etc.)
- Should log record access and sensitive information views
- Need to store detailed information about what changed
- Must implement across all relevant views consistently
- Should include proper error handling

3. Current Progress:
- Basic model structure is in place
- Basic audit creation happening only on patient creation
- Template exists but needs enhancement to show more detail

Please help outline the complete implementation plan and necessary code changes to create a robust audit trail system.
