# Patient Records Dashboard Planning

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Architecture Overview
- Django backend with REST API endpoints for dashboard data
- React frontend for dynamic dashboard components
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- Redis caching for performance optimization

### Core Technologies
1. Frontend Framework
   - React.js for component-based UI
   - Redux for state management
   - React Router for dashboard navigation
   - Typescript for type safety

2. Visualization Libraries
   - Chart.js for basic charts and graphs
   - D3.js for complex custom visualizations
   - react-grid-layout for dashboard layout
   - react-table for data grid displays

3. Data Management
   - Django REST Framework for API endpoints
   - Django Channels for WebSocket connections
   - Pandas for data manipulation
   - NumPy for numerical computations

4. Caching Strategy
   - Redis for server-side caching
   - Browser localStorage for client-side caching
   - Service Workers for offline capability

### API Structure
1. Core Endpoints
   ```python
   /api/dashboard/
   ├── summary/                 # Overview metrics
   ├── vitals/                  # Vitals data
   ├── labs/                    # Lab results
   ├── medications/             # Medication data
   ├── symptoms/                # Symptoms data
   └── trends/                  # Historical trends
   ```

2. Data Processing
   - Server-side aggregation for heavy computations
   - Client-side filtering for user interactions
   - Incremental loading for large datasets
   - WebSocket updates for real-time changes

### Component Architecture
1. Dashboard Container
   ```javascript
   DashboardLayout
   ├── MetricsPanel
   ├── AlertsPanel
   ├── ChartContainer
   │   ├── TimelineChart

   │   └── StatisticsPanel
   └── DataGrid
   ```

2. Reusable Components
   - ChartWrapper (configurable chart component)
   - DataTable (sortable/filterable grid)

   - Role-based access control
   - Session management

2. Data Protection
   - End-to-end encryption
   - HIPAA compliance
   - Audit logging
   - XSS prevention

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit Tests
   - Jest for React components
   - Python unittest for API
   - Mock data generators

2. Integration Tests
   - API endpoint testing
   - WebSocket communication
   - Browser compatibility

3. Performance Tests
   - Load testing
   - Memory profiling
   - Network optimization

### Deployment Configuration
1. Build Process
   - Webpack optimization
   - Code splitting
   - Asset compression
   - Tree shaking

2. Environment Setup
   - Development
   - Staging
   - Production
   - Testing
