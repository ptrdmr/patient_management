# MORISTAT Patient History Management System
## System Abstract

MORISTAT is a specialized healthcare information system designed to provide patients with comprehensive access to and understanding of their complete medical history. Unlike traditional EMR/EHR systems focused on active treatment and day-to-day care, MORISTAT serves as a longitudinal health record aggregator and visualization platform, empowering patients with insights into their health journey over time.

### System Purpose
The platform's primary focus is to:
- Aggregate historical medical data from various sources
- Present medical history in an accessible, understandable format
- Track long-term health trends and patterns
- Maintain a comprehensive record of past treatments, lab results, and diagnoses
- Enable patients to be better informed about their overall health journey

### Core Architecture
The system employs a modular architecture with the following key components:

#### 1. Data Management
- [[tech-specs#Historical Data Store|Historical Data Store]]
- [[tech-specs#Data Import Service|Data Import Services]]
- [[tech-specs#Historical Data Configuration|Data Configuration]]

#### 2. User Interface
- [[tech-specs#Timeline Dashboard System|Timeline Dashboard]]
- [[tech-specs#Historical Data Visualization|Data Visualization]]
- [[tech-specs#Data Import Interface|Import Interface]]

#### 3. Analysis & Processing
- [[tech-specs#Historical Data Processors|Data Processing]]
- [[tech-specs#Trend Analysis Engine|Trend Analysis]]
- [[tech-specs#Search Index|Search Capabilities]]

See [[development-sequence#Development Roadmap|Development Roadmap]] for implementation planning.

### Technical Foundation
