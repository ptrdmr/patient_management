## Safety Framework
Every file in this documentation includes our Core Safety Framework, ensuring consistent safety practices across all aspects of implementation. Key principles include:
- Verify First, Act Second
- Incremental Changes Only
- Protect Sensitive Data
- Constant Verification
- Clear Stop Conditions
- Change Scale Guidelines

## Getting Started
1. Begin with `core/architecture.md` to understand the overall system design
2. Review `migration/plan.md` to understand the implementation approach
3. Refer to implementation details as needed during development
4. Use `testing/strategy.md` to ensure proper validation

## Important Notes
- All changes must follow the Core Safety Framework
- Patient data must be treated as PHI
- When in doubt, stop and ask for clarification
- Always verify changes in staging before production

## Success Metrics
- Page load time < 2s
- Tab switch time < 200ms
- Error rate < 1%
- Cache hit ratio > 90%
- Zero critical accessibility issues
